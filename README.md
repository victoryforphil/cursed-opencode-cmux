# opencode-cmux

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/opencode-cmux)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-cmux)

OpenCode plugin that bridges OpenCode events to cmux notifications and sidebar metadata.

## Requirements

- OpenCode ≥ 1.0
- [cmux](https://cmux.app) (macOS app) installed with CLI accessible at `/usr/local/bin/cmux`
- The plugin is a no-op when not running inside a cmux workspace

## Installation

Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-cmux"]
}
```

OpenCode will download the package automatically on next start.

### Local / development

Build the package, then symlink the output directly into OpenCode's plugin directory:

```bash
ln -sf ~/path/to/opencode-cmux/dist/index.js ~/.config/opencode/plugins/cmux.js
```

Make sure `opencode-cmux` is **not** listed in `opencode.json` when using the symlink, to avoid loading it twice.

## What it does

| Event | cmux action |
|---|---|
| Session starts working | Sidebar status: one combined `working: ...` line showing the latest prompt/tool/thinking/patch activity |
| Subagent starts working | Extra sidebar rows like `• agent-name: searching files` for each active subagent |
| Session completes (primary) | Desktop notification + log + clear status |
| Session completes (subagent) | Log only (no notification spam) |
| Session error | Desktop notification + log + clear status |
| Permission requested | Desktop notification + sidebar status: "waiting" (red, lock icon) |
| AI has a question (`ask` tool) | Desktop notification + sidebar status: "question" (purple) |

## How it works

The plugin responds to OpenCode lifecycle events by firing cmux CLI commands (`cmux notify`, `cmux set-status`, etc.). Each action targets the current cmux workspace, providing ambient awareness of what OpenCode is doing without requiring you to switch context. All commands are no-ops when cmux is not running.
